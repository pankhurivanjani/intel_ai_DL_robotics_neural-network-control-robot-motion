Use neural networks to control a robotâ€™s motion. Additional topics include: 

- Use neural networks for inverse kinematic motion calculation
- Improve training with techniques such as dropout and regularization
- Solve high-dimensional problems by dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA)
